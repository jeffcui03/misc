* The purpose is to keep the tar ball with the script, self-containedThe.  The shell script unpacks the tarball, which is appended after the text, and extracts it

* The tarball is generated by "pip install ", put them together into a tarbll and append to the end of the shell script

    bert_for_tf2-0.14.4.dist-info  params_flow  py_params-0.9.7.dist-info

* in the script,  ARCHOFFSET gives the line number where the tarball data starts (ARCHOFFSET=103)
     tail -n +103 bert_for_tf2_install.sh > bert.tar.bz2
     
* to extract, use "-x", 
     bert_for_tf2_install.sh -x /tmp/bert_packages
     
     ls /tmp/bert_packages
